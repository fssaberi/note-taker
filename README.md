# Note Taker

## Description

This application allows a user to type out new notes and keep them in a list on this siste.

## Software

I used Visual Studio Code to add to the code to create the application. 

## Application

The user clicks "Get Started," and is taken to another html page where they can add a note title and note text. Then the user clicks the "+" icon in the top, right corner, and the note is added to the list on the left of the page. The delete button functionality is in progress. 

## Webpage
